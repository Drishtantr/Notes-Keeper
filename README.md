# Notes-Keeper

The note keeper is a web app that uses a Laravel REST API to create, read, update and delete notes in a single page web application (index.html).
Once I host the REST API and configure it to work with the webpage, live demo will be available.
For the time being, I will add a few screenshots of the page!
